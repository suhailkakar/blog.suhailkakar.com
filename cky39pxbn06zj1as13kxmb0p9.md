## What are NFTs
NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are tokens that can be used to indicate ownership of unique items. In other words, fungible refers to anything that may be replaced. As a result, the term "non-fungible" refers to something that cannot be interchanged.

Cryptocurrencies and physical money are both "fungible," which means they may be traded or exchanged for one another. However NFTs are different, a non-fungible token has distinct features that ensure that no two non-fungible entities are ever identical.
