## Typescript vs Javascript : Which one should you use for your next project ?

### Introduction

JavaScript is a scripting language for building dynamic web pages. It adhered to client-side development principles, thus it operates entirely within the user's web browser and requires no resources from the web server. Javascript may also be used with other technologies such as REST APIs, XML, and others.

Typescript is a superset of Javascript. It is a statically built language for writing Javascript code that is straightforward and simple. It may be used with Node.js or any browser that supports ECMAScript 3 or above. 

### Difference Between Javascript and Typescript

<tr>
<td><strong>Typescript</strong></td>
<td><strong>Javascript</strong></td>
</tr>
<td>To make the code comprehensible for browsers, it will convert to JavaScript code.</td>
<td>Can be directly used in browsers</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>There is support for ES3, ES4, ES5 and ES6</td>
<td>No support for compiling additional ES3, ES4, ES5 or ES6 features</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>During the compilation process, errors can be identified and rectified.</td>
<td>Because it is an interpreted language, errors can only be discovered during runtime.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Since it is a superset, all the JavaScript libraries, and other JavaScript code works without any changes</td>
<td>JS libraries work by default</td>
</tr>
<td>Functions can have optional parameters</td>
<td>This feature is not possible in JavaScript</td>

### Features of Javascript

- It's utilised on both the client and server sides.
- It's simple to learn and use, and it's a cross-platform language.
- Strong Testing Workflow
- It's a dynamic language: flexible and powerful

### Features of Typescript

- It's a dynamic language that's both versatile and strong.
- Offered great productivity for developers & Maintainability
- Code 'discoverability' & refactoring
- Optional Static Type Annotation / Static Typing

### Which one is better ?

JavaScript is excellent for experienced developers working on relatively small coding tasks. However, if you have a development team with experience and understanding, Typescript is the best alternative.
