## The Ultimate Guide to Web 3.0 - Everything you need to know about Web 3.0 before learning it

You've probably heard about Web3 unless you've been living under a rock. Web 3.0 is the next step in the web's growth, and it aims to make the internet more intelligent. Before learning more about Web3, let's understand the evolution of the web first.  

Over the last few years, the World Wide Web has developed, bringing with it new tools and strategies. Web 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 are typical names for these stages. Now let's understand each of their stags. 

## Web 1.0 
It is the first stage in the evolution of the web, which is also referred as the read-only web. Web 1.0 websites were not as dynamic and interactive as it is now. The primary goal of the websites was to make the information available to the general public. As servers were improved, average connection speeds rose, and developers gained new skills and techniques, the shift from Web 1.0 to 2.0 took occurred over time.

## Web 2.0
It is the second stage in the evolution of the web, which is also referred as the read-write web. It's just a better version of the first worldwide web, marked by the shift from static to dynamic or user-generated content, as well as the rise of social media.

Some of the famous Web 2.0 applications are Google Maps, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, WordPress and etc. Web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript frameworks such as ReactJs, AngularJs, VueJs, and others enable users to come up with new concepts, allowing users to contribute more to this Social Web.

Now that you have a good understanding of the evolution of the web and its old stages, Let's understand, What is hell is this Web 3.0. 

## Web 3.0
It is the third stage in the evolution of the web, which is also referred as the read-write-execute which refers to the future of the web.  In this era, artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning enable computers to understand data in the same way that people do.

Web3 applications or DApps, are developed on decentralized peer-to-peer networks like Ethereum and IPFS. These networks are developed, operated, and maintained by their users, rather than by a business. They self-organize and don't have a single point of failure.

You'll notice that when you hear about Web3, cryptocurrencies are frequently mentioned. This is due to the fact that many of these protocols include cryptocurrencies. Anyone who wishes to help create, control, or improve one of the projects is given a cash incentive (tokens). 

These protocols frequently provide a wide range of services, including computation, storage, bandwidth, identification, hosting, and other online services previously supplied by cloud providers.


### What makes Web 3.0 so unique?

Web 3's major benefit is that it seeks to solve the most serious issue that has arisen as a result of Web 2: the gathering of personal data by private networks, which is subsequently sold to marketers or potentially stolen by hackers.

Web 3's network is decentralized, meaning it is not controlled by a single organization, and the decentralized applications (apps) created on top of it are open.

### Properties of Web 3.0

The following are three key characteristics that can help us define Web 3.0:

#### Semantic Web
One of the key elements of Web 3.0 is ‚Äúsemantic web.‚Äù. The semantic web enhances online technologies by allowing users to create, share, and connect content via search and analysis based on the ability to understand the meaning of words rather than keywords or numbers.

#### 3D Graphics

3D Graphics is being used widely in websites and services in Web 3.0 such as online games, e-commerce, and portfolio website.  [Here](https://bruno-simon.com/)  is the best example of a 3d website by Bruno Simon. 

#### Artificial Intelligence

Semantic Web and Artificial Intelligence are the two cornerstones of web 3.0. By combining this capacity with natural language processing, Web 3.0 allows computers to comprehend material in the same way that people do, resulting in quicker and more relevant results. To meet the demands of users, they grow increasingly intelligent.

### What is Web3.js

The Web3.js library is the primary JavaScript library you'll use while creating Web3 applications. web3.js is a set of libraries that let you use an HTTP or IPC connection to communicate with a local or distant ethereum node.

The Ethereum blockchain is accessed with the web3 JavaScript library. It can access user accounts, send transactions, and communicate with smart contracts, among other things. In fact, Web3.js is one of the main frameworks used in designing dApps.
