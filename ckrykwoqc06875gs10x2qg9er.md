## Integrate Auth0 with React JS  - A step by step tutorial

A few days ago Hashnode announced that they are partnering with Auth0 for a hackathon with some prize money on the line, but In my point of view most of you guys didn't know much about Auth0 and their SDKs. so I thought it would be a good opportunity for you to learn about them now. Therefore in this article, I am going to teach you how to integrate Auth0 with React JS ( A popular JavaScript frontend library). 


## Creating a react app

The first step is to create a simple react app which you can do just by running the command below in your terminal. 

```sh
npx create-react-app react-auth0
```
This might take a while and it depends on your computer specs but once it is done go to the new directory which is created ( In our case `react-auth0` ) and run `npm start` or `yarn start`. This command will start the development server for your react app. Now open this directory (In our case `react-auth0`) in any code editor

## Cleaning up the project
Once you opened the directory in your code editor, You can see that there are many files and folders, but for this project, we don't need most of them. Let's go ahead and delete the files which we don't need. In the `src` folder delete all files except `App.js`, `Index.js`, and `App.css`. 

Once you change delete everything which is inside of `App.js` and paste the below code instead. 

```jsx
import React from 'react'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>React x Auth0</h1>
    </div>
  )
}

```
also delete everything which is inside of `Index.js` and paste the below code instead. 
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```
and also delete everything inside of `App.css`. Now in the `public` folder delete everything except `index.html`. Delete everything which is inside of the `index.html` and instead paste the below code 
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <title>React x Auth-</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```
Finally, this is how your folder structure should look like ðŸ‘‡
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ public
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.css
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.js
â””â”€â”€ yarn.lock
```

## Installing and Adding Auth0 in your project

Now It is time to install auth0 in our react application, to do that simply run 

```
npm i @auth0/auth0-react
```
This will install Auth0 in your react application, once it is done your need to import `Auth0Provider` in `index.js` and wrap your `React.StrictMode` inside of it. It should look similar this this 

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";
import { Auth0Provider } from "@auth0/auth0-react";

ReactDOM.render(
  <Auth0Provider>
    <React.StrictMode>
      <App />
    </React.StrictMode>
  </Auth0Provider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```
`Auth0Provider` takes two mandatory props `domain`, `clientId` and `redirectUri`. To get these data we need to create an application in Auth0

### Creating an application in Auth0

Go to auth0.com and signup for a new account, once you completed the signup process you will be redirected to your dashboard that will look similar to the below image.

![screely-1628140498452.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1628140528904/w3ed-Zxz9.png)
Click on **Create Application** ( This second box in your dashboard ), this will open a popup that you need to fill some data in it. In the name input, enter your application name and select **Single Page Web Application** as an application type and click on create button. Once you clicked on **create**, It will create the application and you will be redirected to your application dashboard. In the settings tab you can edit your application logo, type, redirect uri and etc but for now, copy the Domain and Client Id and pass them as a props to `Auth0Provider` and in the redirectUri write `window.location.origin` which should finally look like this 
```jsx
  <Auth0Provider 
    domain="YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN" 
    clientId="YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID"  
    redirectUri={window.location.origin}
    >
    <React.StrictMode>
      <App />
    </React.StrictMode>
  </Auth0Provider>
```

> The origin property returns the protocol, hostname, and port number of a URL
 

### Creating Components

Now Let's create some UI components so that users can login, see their profile data, and logout. Therefore go ahead and create a new directory in your `src` folder named `components`. In the `components` create a new file named `LoginButton.js`.

Open  `LoginButton.js` in your code editor and create a simple button. Here is my code for the button. 

```javascript
// LoginButton.js

import React from 'react'
import '../App.css'
function LoginButton(props) {
	return (
		<div>
			<button className="loginButton">Login</button>
		</div>
	)
}

export default LoginButton
```

```css
  /* App.css */

body {
  background-color: #2a2a2a;
  margin: auto;
}
.loginButton {
  background-image: linear-gradient( to right, #5e93cf, #303a44);
  width: 160px;
  font-size: 16px;
  font-weight: 600;
  color: #fff;
  cursor: pointer;
  margin: 20px;
  height: 55px;
  text-align:center;
  border: none;
  background-size: 300% 100%;
  border-radius: 50px;
}
```
 Now you need to import `LoginButton.js` in your `App.js`, once you are done your `App.js` should look like this

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import LoginButton from './components/LoginButton'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <LoginButton />
    </div>
  )
}
```
If you used my code for the button you should see an output similar to below image
![screely-1628142363149.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1628142421874/lEKKtHgKG.png)

Similarly use the same code for Logout, Create a new file in components directory named `LogoutButton.js` and paste the same code of `LoginButton.js` into it. 

### Adding Login Functionality 

In your `LogoutButton.js` import `userAuth0` from '@auth0/auth0-react` and create a constant named `LoginWithRedirect`. Once you are done add `onClick` to button and add  `LoginWithRedirect`, just like the code below

```jsx
// LoginButton.js

import { useAuth0 } from '@auth0/auth0-react'
import React from 'react'
import '../App.css'

function LoginButton(props) {
	const { loginWithRedirect } = useAuth0()
	return (
		<div>
			<button 
				onClick={()=>loginWithRedirect()} 
				className="loginButton"
				>
				Login
				</button>
		</div>
	)
}

export default LoginButton
```


> Add `http://localhost:3000` in **Allowed Callback URLs**, **Allowed Logout URLs**, **Allowed Web Origins** and **Allowed Origins (CORS)**  in settings tab of your application. 

%[https://www.loom.com/share/a9d7ed95e83b4f499cf0b712b9ed5950]

and now you have login functionality in your app :)

### Getting Profile Data 

Now in your `App.js` import useAuth0 and create a constant named `user`. After that below `LoginButton`, Stringify the JSON to print it in the web page, The `App.js` code should look like this 


```jsx
import React from 'react'
import LoginButton from './components/LoginButton'
import { useAuth0 } from '@auth0/auth0-react'
export default function App() {
  const {user} = useAuth0()
  return (
    <div>
      <LoginButton />
      {JSON.stringify(user)}
    </div>
  )
}
```

After successful login in your app, you should see JSON data in your webpage, similar to this 

```json
{
    "given_name":"John",
    "family_name":"Doe",
    "nickname":"john.doe",
    "name":"John Doe",
    "picture":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AsadaASDJNASD",
    "locale":"en",
    "updated_at":"2021-08-05T06:40:00.136Z",
    "email":"john.doe@gmail.com",
    "email_verified":true,
    "sub":"google-oauth2|11707210123641293850812"
}
```

### Adding Logout Functionality

The logout is pretty similar to login, You just need to change `loginWithRedirect` to `logout`. and you should have similar Logout component 

```
// LogoutButton.js
import { useAuth0 } from '@auth0/auth0-react'
import React from 'react'
import '../App.css'

function Logout(props) {
	const { logout } = useAuth0()
	return (
		<div>
			<button 
				onClick={()=>logout()} 
				className="loginButton"
				>
				Logout
				</button>
		</div>
	)
}

export default Logout
```
Now, When the user clicks on logout, It will remove the profile data of the user :)
