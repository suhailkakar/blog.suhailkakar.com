## How To Solve Captcha in JavaScript Using 2Captcha


You may already solve many captchas while submitting a form or signing up for a website. The basic Captcha goal is to check whether the user is a human or a bot. Captcha stands for **Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart**. Captchas are used to stop spamming blogs, accessing bots, and making a website more secure. 

Sometimes it is easy to solve the captcha, however, some of them are just a headache to the users, It might take minutes to think whether the letter is in Upper Case or Lower Case. Therefore, nowadays users prefer to use captcha-solving software.

## How to solve Captcha in JavaScript using 2Captcha

Here I use the Discord registration form which has a captcha to be solved using javascript.

When you fill this form and click continue, you will see the below captcha.


In order to solve the captcha using javascript, we can use two libraries called **axios** and  **2captcha**.  The axios is used to handle all the API calls and 2captcha is used to solve the captcha. install the bellow packages after creating your file.

``` 
npm install axios

``` 
``` 
npm install 2captcha

``` 



- import these libraries to your file 

```
const axios = require("axios");

const Captcha = require("2captcha");

``` 

- Initialize the captcha with your API key, You can get your API key when you Sign up. The API_KEY is available on your dashboard at the Account setting 


```
const solver = new Captcha.Solver("API_KEY");

``` 


- define an async function, here we call it register. 
we can solve the captcha using the solver which we already initialized and Hcaptcha is the type of captcha that we have on Discord website.
It requires two parameters, the Site key and the website URL. The 


```
 const register = async () => {
  console.log("solving...");
  const { data } = await solver.hcaptcha(
    "f5561ba9-8f1e-40ca-9b5b-a0b3f719ef34",
    "https://discord.com/register"
  );


``` 
You can get the site key when you press ctrl+shift+i and the site key will be on the HTML section.

Use try-catch, as it may have any error and inside the try, we can ake the Axios call. Here the method is Post and you should specify the request URL.



![screely-1636558440402.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1636558453095/7ESFoarKw.png)

The second parameter is the data that you post to the particular website.
The captcha key value will be the data we specify earlier. I got the data when I filled the discord form and it sent a request.


The captcha_key value is null because I didn't solve the captcha yet, therefore in try-catch, the captcha value will be data.

```javascript
 try {
    let result = await axios.post("https://discord.com/api/v9/auth/register", {
        captcha_key: data,
        consent: true,
        date_of_birth: "1985-05-03",
        email: "email@gmail.com",
        fingerprint: "907561243135578163.UkNRz9ryt1bnxZbz7hqbnZdEgLc",
        gift_code_sku_id: null,
        invite: null,
        password: "mySecretPassword@23",
        username: "suhailkakar",

    });
    console.log(result.data);
} catch (e) {
    console.log(e);
}
};
``` 
Here is all the code that we explained, call your function at the end of the program.


```javascript

const axios = require("axios");
const Captcha = require("2captcha");

const solver = new Captcha.Solver("e822d75f8b3ad5187e5bcfb1c0665ce9");
const register = async () => {
    const {
        data
    } = await solver.hcaptcha(
        "f5561ba9-8f1e-40ca-9b5b-a0b3f719ef34",
        "https://discord.com/register"
    );

    try {
        let result = await axios.post("https://discord.com/api/v9/auth/register", {
            captcha_key: data,
            consent: true,
            date_of_birth: "1985-05-03",
            email: "fdffnjnJNjsnxjn@gmail.com",
            fingerprint: "907561243135578163.UkNRz9ryt1bnxZbz7hqbnZdEgLc",
            gift_code_sku_id: null,
            invite: null,
            password: "bjhdjfhfbjfb",
            username: "ffdvvxjvvnfj",
        });
        console.log(result.data);
    } catch (e) {
        console.log(e);
    }
};
register();

``` 

- Run node your_file_name, in our case node app.js on the terminal.

It will take a bit of time and then you will receive a token. We will use the below function to pass the token and 

```js
function login(token) {
    setInterval(() => {
        document.body.appendChild(document.createElement `iframe`).contentWindow.localStorage.token = `"${token}"`
    }, 50);
    setTimeout(() => {
        location.reload();
    }, 2500);
}

``` 
Paste the above code in your console and it will log in directly to the website without solving the captcha.
