## An Ultimate Guide to Git and Github

As a developer, we all know a little about Git and GitHub but there are some developers who still have doubt and question about Git and GitHub. Therefore in this article, I am going to break everything down regarding Git and GitHub, so that you can understand it clearly. 


## Introduction
Git is a source code management technology used by DevOps. It is a free and open-source version control system that is used to efficiently manage small to extremely big projects.

Git is a version control system. Version control is a file manager that maintains track of changes to your projects over time and keeps a complete history of whatever you're working on. It allows many developers around the globe to work together on the same project at the same time

GitHub is a site that hosts Git repositories, but it also has a lot of its own features. It is a web-based graphical interface for Git, which is a command-line application. Each project has access control and numerous collaborative capabilities, such as wikis and rudimentary task management tools.

It is the home of 56 million ( September 2020 ) developers around the globe which is currently owned by Microsoft

## Installation 
Every operating system has its own steps to install Git, In this article, I will cover Linux, Windows, and Mac ( Which are the most popular ones )
### Linux
If you are a Linux user ( like me ), you will probably know that the Linux family is very big and It has many distros such as Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch and etc.
However, in this article, I will cover Debian ( Ubuntu ) and Fedora

## Basic GitHub terms

1.  **Fork**: Fork is a copy of another user's repository that lives on your personal Github account. The major reason for this is to adapt other people's repositories to meet your needs.
2. **Main**: When you create a new repository, it comes with a default development branch. 
3. **Readme**: It is a text file that contains information about other files in a repository. It is usually a basic plain text file called Read Me that serves as documentation.
4. **Repository**: A Repository is a place where tour work will be stored in a directory or storage space. This is sometimes abbreviated as "repo" by GitHub users.
5. **License**: If you want your repository to be genuinely open source, you'll need to license it so that others can use, modify, and distribute it.
6. **Pull request**: It allows you to announce a change made by you in the branch. It is a way for a developer to let the rest of the team know when they've finished a feature.

## Basic Git Command
1. `git init`: The git init command creates a new Git repository. Executing this command creates a `.git` subdirectory in the current working directory, which contains all of the necessary Git metadata for the new repository. 
2. `git clone`: The git clone command is used to create a copy of a specific repository or branch within a repository.
3. `git branch <branch-name>`: This git command is used to create a new branch for a specific repository. 
4. `git checkout <branch-name>`: The git checkout command lets you navigate between the branches created by the git branch.
5. `git add`: It is the first command in a chain of operations that directs Git to "save" a snapshot of the current project state, into the commit history. It is used to tracks your file and changes in Git
6. `git commit`: The git commit command takes a snapshot of the current state of the project's changes.
7. `git push` : This command is used to upload git commits to a remote repository like Github

GitHub offers a special repository by your username, which should contain a `readme.md` and it will show in your GitHub profile, just like mine
