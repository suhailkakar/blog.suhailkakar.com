## 13 Projects You Can Do to Become a Web3 and Blockchain Master - Beginner to Expert

Learning to code can be difficult and confusing, especially if you aren't sure where to start. The greatest approach to improve your Web3 skills is to use them to create projects.

In this article, I will be sharing 13 projects that you can build to level up your Web3 and Blockchain skills, whether you're a novice or returning to coding.

Before we get into the projects, let's have a look at what decentralized apps are and how they work.


A decentralized app (dApp) is a digital application or program that resides and runs on a blockchain or peer-to-peer network of computers rather than a single computer and is independent of anyone's authority's control

Decentralized applications, or DApps, are programs that are not controlled by a single organization and play an important role in the blockchain world. These decentralized apps run on a blockchain network in a public, open-source, and decentralized environment devoid of central control and influence.

Now that you know what a dapp is, let's have a look at some of the projects you may create to improve your Web3 skills.
  
### ERC-20 Token

Cryptocurrencies have recently gained popularity, providing businesses and individuals with limitless opportunities. On the Ethereum blockchain, an ERC20 token is a standard for creating and issuing smart contracts. On our list, this is one of the most basic projects. You can make your own token and test it on any network. 

Check out this [guide](https://www.quicknode.com/guides/solidity/how-to-create-and-deploy-an-erc20-token) by [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/) on "How to create and deploy an ERC20 token".
